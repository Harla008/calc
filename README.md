# LMRallyFillCalc

Really simple calulator for fillers to know what comp to send.

The calculator takes 3 inputs, the rally composition, number of troops you are sending and the percentage of t5.

There is no proper error checking, this is just a quick dumb calculator.


COMPOSITION
-------------------
Input for the comp will be 3 numbers. Numbers will always add up to either 10 or 20 e.g 442, 974, 235 and so on.

Number of Troops
-------------------
The number of troops you are sending in thousands. E.g if sending 200k just type 200, no "k". Added letter will crash the program. Yes I'm lazy

Percentage of T5
-------------------
When entering the percentage dont put "%" at the end, just the number will do. Send 60% minimum or you're a bitch. Dunno what happens if you put 0%, never tried
